**_The Return_**
by

Rodrigo Camina


**_First Act - The Conflict_**

> 2197. After almost a century of conflicts and crisis, earth is polarized between two extremely aggressive trade federations. The Free Trade Organization (FTO), that is formed by allies from the old block of European capitalist countries, Oceania countries, North American and Latin American countries, and The Soyuz Federation(SF), formed by the old communist block, African countries, Middle East countries and South East Asian countries. These groups made great advances in science and technology. Things like space travels to other star systems in the galaxy, genetic improvements and full integration among biological, electronic and mechanical technology were about to be achieved. The disputes over resources are strong and violent.


**_Second Act - The Experiment_**

> For the last 10 years, these two federations stay in a cold war situation and FTO started a dangerous program of genetic enhanced super soldiers, using mutagens to make them stronger, faster but more than that, making them resistant to bio weapons specially design to kill everyone but those who have these genetic improvements. It didn't take too long to SF scientists to figure out what was happening and SF spies were ordered to do anything possible to get the data about that research. And they did it, so SF started their own program too. The research never stops on both sides and FTO started a secret program of a machine that could finish the conflict and change the balance to their side, a machine that could instantly teleport their troops to any point. As always, secret service of SF was very good and they soon revealed this secret and SF decided that this machine was too dangerous and should be destroyed. Their spies were ordered to infiltrate and destroy the machine.

**_Third Act - The Rupture_**

> The moment of glory for FTO is about to start. The machine is ready to be tested and the scientists are all excited. But there is one important thing that they don't know...The machine was rigged by a SF spy inside FTO. The spy changed the coordinates of arrival for the troops and some configurations to make the tests fail and hoping to kill some FTO soldiers in the process. But something went really bad. The sabotage did more than just move soldiers to the wrong place. The changes overloaded the machine and caused a chain reaction that started an irreversible fail. After a few seconds an explosion destroyed the whole complex and caused a reaction that took over the whole earth atmosphere. In seconds all non-mutagen people from both sides disappeared followed by their mutagen soldiers few seconds after. The explosion caused a rupture in the space-time continuun, sending all mutagen soldiers to different points in the galaxy and those non-mutagen people 9700 years in the future on earth.


**_Fourth Act - The Reunion_**

> Since all humans were moved to other points of space and time, earth had no humans for about 9700 years and wildlife ran free over the whole planet. Almost all buildings and strucutures were destroyed or damaged. Just a few human ships from both sides were intact because those ships were docked on space and were not under the influence of that shockwave from the rupture. Those humans aboard the ships were moved to the future too, so when they woke up they started the recolonization of earth but the conflict was never forgotten and during the exploration of the galaxy for more resources, scientists of both sides discovered the fate of those soldiers that disappeared. They were all teleported to several planets spreaded all over the galaxy.
> During 97 generations these genetically improved humans started to adapt and evolve based on the natural features of these planets. From generation to generation, stories are told and legends are created among these evolved humans and they had developed their own religions, technology, culture, language, genetic profile, features, etc, some of them living in tribes or other way of social organization.
> After discovering these evolved humans, both federations took advantage of their culture and religion and use that to recruit them to fight in their war on earth and other planets and systems in the galaxy, trying to make use of their powers.
